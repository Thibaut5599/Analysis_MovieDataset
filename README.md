# Movie Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores global cinema trends by analyzing movies released between 1970 and 2024. The analysis focuses on three main areas: trends in movie ratings over time, genre popularity and evolution across decades, and global cinema diversity across genres and filmmakers.

## Objectives
- Trends in movie ratings over time
- Genre popularity and evolution by decade
- Global cinema diversity through genres and filmmakers

## Project Contents
- Jupyter Notebook : Movies_1910-2024.ipynb file shows the full data preparation process and descriptive analysis of the dataset.
- Datasets : Original dataset (16k_Movies.csv) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kashifsahil/16000-movies-1910-2024-metacritic) and cleaned and enriched dataset (Cleaned_16k_Movies.csv) ready for abalysis or further projects.
- Screenshots : Screenshots_Plotly_Charts folder contains some PNG files corresponding to the plotly graphics screenshots inserted in the Jupyter Notebook.
- Tableau Dashboard : Analysis_MovieDataset.twbx file is an interactive dashboard for exploring genres, ratings, and other aspects of the dataset.

## Results and Conclusion
The visualizations and analysis indicate no strong correlations or clear trends within the dataset. A straightforward descriptive analysis, complemented by interactive visualizations in Tableau, provides a broad view for exploring movies released between 1970 and 2024.
