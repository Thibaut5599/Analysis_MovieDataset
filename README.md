# Analysis MovieDataset (Metacritic)

## Project Overview
Metacritic is a website that aggregates reviews of films, television shows, music albums, video games, and formerly books.

This project explores global cinema trends by analyzing movies released between 1970 and 2024 (data from the [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/) website). The analysis focuses on three main areas : trends in movie ratings over time, genre popularity and evolution across decades, and global cinema diversity across genres and filmmakers.

## Objectives
- Trends in movie ratings over time
- Genre popularity and evolution by decade
- Global cinema diversity through genres and filmmakers

## Project Contents
- **Jupyter Notebook :** Movies_1910-2024.ipynb file shows the full data preparation process and descriptive analysis of the dataset.
- **Datasets :** Original dataset (16k_Movies.csv) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kashifsahil/16000-movies-1910-2024-metacritic) and cleaned and enriched dataset (Cleaned_16k_Movies.csv) ready for analysis or further projects.
- **Screenshots :** Screenshots_Plotly_Charts folder contains some PNG files corresponding to the plotly graphics screenshots inserted in the Jupyter Notebook.
- **Tableau Dashboard :** Analysis_MovieDataset.twbx file is an interactive dashboard for exploring genres, ratings, and other aspects of the dataset.

## Results and Conclusion
The visualizations and analysis indicate no strong correlations or clear trends within the dataset. A straightforward descriptive analysis, complemented by interactive visualizations in Tableau, provides a broad view for exploring movies released between 1970 and 2024.
